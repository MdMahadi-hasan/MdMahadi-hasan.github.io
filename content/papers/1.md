##### Abstract

This thesis examines the effectiveness of different management structures in
optimizing reservoir recreation in the United States, focusing on the roles of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) and state-level management agency. The research utilizes
visitation data from both federal and state managed reservoirs and develop an econometric
model to investigate the impacts of these management approaches on recreational use.
This study is designed to quantify the influence of management decisions on reservoir
visitation rates, amidst their broader functionalities including flood control, hydropower,
and environmental conservation.
