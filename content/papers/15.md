##### Abstract

Recent evidence shows that the divine coincidence might prevail in the United States. That is, inflation is stable, on target whenever the labor market is efficient; inflation rises whenever the labor market is inefficiently tight; and inflation falls whenever the labor market is inefficiently tight. The divine coincidence might explain the flare-up in inflation in 2021–2023. Indeed, the US labor market has been inefficiently tight in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, which might have fueled the flare-up in inflation. The divine coincidence is also important for policy. If it holds, the full-employment and price-stability mandates of the Federal Reserve would just coincide—greatly simplifying the Fed's task. This paper proposes a simple, earthly model in which the divine coincidence holds—proving that the phenomenon of divine coincidence might not be entirely surprising. In the model, unemployment arises because all trades occur through a matching function. A Phillips curve relating unemployment to inflation arises from Moen's (1997) directed search. The Phillips curve is nonvertical thanks to Rotemberg's (1982) price-adjustment costs. The model's Phillips curve guarantees that inflation is on target when unemployment is efficient, generating the divine coincidence.
