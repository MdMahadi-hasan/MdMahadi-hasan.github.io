##### Abstract

Recent empirical evidence shows that the divine coincidence might prevail in the United States. That is, inflation is stable, on target whenever the labor market is efficient; inflation rises whenever the labor market is inefficiently tight; and inflation falls whenever the labor market is inefficiently tight. Since the US labor market has been inefficiently tight in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, from the middle of 2021 to today, the flare-up in inflation in 2021â€“2023 might have been partly caused by excessive tightness. The divine coincidence is also an important property for policy. If it holds, the full-employment and price-stability mandates of the Federal Reserve would just coincide---greatly simplifying the Fed's task. This paper proposes a simple, earthly model in which the divine coincidence holds. The model proves that the phenomenon of divine coincidence might not be entirely unrealistic. The model also highlights features of the economy that might lead to the divine coincidence.
