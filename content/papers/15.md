##### Abstract
 
Recent evidence shows that the divine coincidence might prevail in the United States. That is, inflation is on target whenever the labor market is efficient; inflation rises above target whenever the labor market is inefficiently tight; and inflation falls below target whenever the labor market is inefficiently slack. Since the US labor market has been inefficiently tight in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, the divine coincidence might explain the flare-up in inflation in 2021–2023. The divine coincidence is also important for policy, because it implies that the full-employment and price-stability mandates of the Federal Reserve coincide. This paper proposes a simple, earthly model in which the divine coincidence holds—proving that the phenomenon of divine coincidence might not be entirely surprising. In the model, unemployment arises because all trades occur through a matching function. A Phillips curve relating unemployment to inflation arises from Moen's (1997) directed search. The Phillips curve is nonvertical thanks to Rotemberg's (1982) price-adjustment costs. The model's Phillips curve guarantees that inflation is on target when unemployment is efficient, generating the divine coincidence.
