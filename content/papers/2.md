##### Abstract
This study investigates the impact of India's trade policies on U.S. pulse markets,
focusing on pea and lentil prices between 2006 and 2020. Utilizing Asymmetric GARCH
models, we analyze the effects of India's import quota on price volatility and risk premia
in these markets. Our findings reveal a significant increase in risk premia post-quota,
particularly for lentils and green peas. These results highlight the challenges for U.S.
producers, including price volatility and its implications for farm revenues, input costs,
and access to financing. The study underscores the need for policymakers to address these
import restrictions, considering their substantial impact on commodity market stability and
producer profitability
