# Obesity Prediction Model

## Dataset Introduction

This project utilizes a dataset focused on obesity indicators among individuals. The dataset includes various features such as Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI (Body Mass Index), Physical Activity Level, and an Obesity Category that classifies each individual as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, or Obese.

## Why Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is chosen for this analysis due to its efficiency in handling binary classification problems. In our case, we aim to predict whether an individual is Obese or Non-Obese based on the given features. Logistic Regression is particularly suitable here because it not only provides a binary outcome but also estimates the probability of each classification, offering deeper insights into the factors influencing obesity.

## Data Preprocessing

Before diving into the model, it's crucial to prepare the data for analysis. This involves encoding categorical variables, handling missing values if any, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Loading the Dataset

 ```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'path/to/your/dataset.csv'
obesity_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

```
Economic slack represents a waste of productive resources, and it therefore is something that should be limited. In addition to its wastefulness, unemployment generates other, large costs to society. People who are unemployed suffer from lower mental and physical health than employed workers. Even employed people in areas with high unemployment report lower well-being. Accordingly, good economic policy should stabilize economic slack at a desirable level and avoid periods of elevated slack.

The course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models. In the course we cover several models of economic slack and use them to answer a range of questions:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = obesity_data[['Age', 'GenderEncoded', 'Height', 'Weight', 'BMI', 'PhysicalActivityLevel']]
y = obesity_data['ObesityBinaryEncoded']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
