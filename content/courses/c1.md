# Obesity Prediction Model

## Dataset Introduction

This project utilizes a dataset focused on obesity indicators among individuals. The dataset includes various features such as Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI (Body Mass Index), Physical Activity Level, and an Obesity Category that classifies each individual as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, or Obese.

## Why Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is chosen for this analysis due to its efficiency in handling binary classification problems. In our case, we aim to predict whether an individual is Obese or Non-Obese based on the given features. Logistic Regression is particularly suitable here because it not only provides a binary outcome but also estimates the probability of each classification, offering deeper insights into the factors influencing obesity.

## Data Preprocessing

Before diving into the model, it's crucial to prepare the data for analysis. This involves encoding categorical variables, handling missing values if any, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Loading the Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'path/to/your/dataset.csv'
obesity_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
